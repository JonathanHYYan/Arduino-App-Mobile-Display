# Interactive Demo of Arduino App Designed by Eleni Christopoulou

This project is a showcase of a Home Smart Device Mobile Controller App Designed by Eleni Chirstopoulou as a part of a Univeristy Software Engineering Project. The Original project was coded in JAVA designed to be used with Arduino hardware.

The code here is not representative of what was written by the original author and is merely a front end rendition of the features of the intended final design.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run all standard react scripts.
